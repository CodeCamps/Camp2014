It's called _Haunted House Crashers_.  Here's the roll call:\r\n\r\n* Benjamin A.\r\n* Trevor A.\r\n* Bobby C.\r\n* Jackson D.\r\n* Drake H.\r\n* Tanner J.\r\n* Mark S.\r\n* Austin S.\r\n* Lexy T.\r\n* Michael Y.\r\n\r\nThe class is lead by @groundh0g, and the camp counselor is Hanna.\r\n\r\n## Haunted House Crashers\r\n\r\nA side-scrolling smash'em up, similar to Castle Crashers. The current design supports one to four players.\r\n\r\nThe players are kids who are scared by a man in a hockey mask, and run into a haunted house. Once in the house, they take on the persona of their choosing - warrior, mage, monk, or archer. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe group works their way through the house, battling all sorts of baddies. In the final battle, you have to defeat the man in the mask to complete the game.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nAs we get closer to the end of the week, I'll try to post screenshots or videos of our progress.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
